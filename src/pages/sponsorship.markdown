# Sponsorship

We can't put on nodeschool events here in Baltimore without some help from awesome sponsors. As of right now we have two types of somewhat loosely-defined sponsorship opportunities:


### Space sponsorship

Providing a location to meet with adequate space, collaborative seating, good location, parking if possible, and solid wi-fi internet and other technical needs such as projector, sound for music, etc.

### Financial sponsorship

Currently this amount is at $200 (per event)* to go toward food, drinks, supplies (signs, name badges, posters, etc) and swag (printing stickers, lanyards for mentors, t-shirts are a possibility).

PayPal or advance check works best here, but some companies have preferred to pick up food/drinks themselves and bring them to the event, for example. We'll work with whatever works for you. :)

_*Note: the $200 amount has worked well so far but may be adjusted depending on the size and type of event._

### What you get

At either of these levels, your company name/description goes on our website, you're free to bring a sign and/or swag to put up at the event, and you can give a quick 2 minute plug during the event at some point.

This is also a pretty good opportunity to get in front of area node developers if you'd like to mention job opportunities, also.

## Ok, ready to give us $$$?

Send an email to jason.matthew.rhodes@gmail.com outlining what kind of sponsorship you're interested in and we'll work with you to figure out what works best.

## Thanks!!!!!
