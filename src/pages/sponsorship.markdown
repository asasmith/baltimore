# Sponsorship

We can't put on nodeschool events here in Baltimore without some help from awesome sponsors. We want to make sponsorship as easy as possible, so if you'd like to sponsor an upcoming event, just go to the registration page and buy a sponsor ticket. 

A sponsor ticket currently includes (subject to change):

* **Entry to the event for 2 representatives.** Obviously, the event is free so you can send whoever you like, but we ask that you either send people who are participating in the event, or send a max of 1-2 reps who are only there to represent you as a sponsor. 

* **A place to put your sign and/or swag.** Bring your logo sign, a box of giveaways, etc. Just please make sure anything you are giving away is respectful of our [code of conduct](conduct-code.html).

* **A 2-minute pitch during our mid-event break.** This is a great time to raise awareness of your company, pitch open job positions, etc. to a room full of eager JavaScript learners. Again, please keep the pitch brief and respectful of our [code of conduct](conduct-code.html).

If you have any questions, please contact Jason at jason.matthew.rhodes@gmail.com.
