# Code of Conduct

All attendees, mentors, volunteers and sponsors at **baltimore nodeschool** events are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event to the best of our ability. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe and welcoming environment for everyone.

## How to Report Harassment

Report any activity that violates this code of conduct to any volunteer, all of who have been instructed to bring all reports to the organizers immediately. Other perfectly acceptable methods of reporting harassment include:

* Twitter: [@bmorenodeschool](http://twitter.com/bmorenodeschool)
* **Email or call the organizers**: email and phone numbers will be posted clearly and pointed out at the start of each event.

## The Quick Version

**baltimore nodeschool** is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. In short, if you are harassing someone _or if someone interprets your actions as being harassment_, you will definitely be asked to stop and possibly asked to leave (without refund where applicable) at the discretion of the event organizers.

Two important notes:

1. Sexual language, innuendo, and imagery are not appropriate at any baltimore nodeschool event and any reports of these or other harassment will be taken seriously by event organizers whenever noticed or reported.
2. We expect participants to follow these rules at all **baltimore nodeschool** events, including pre- and post-event socializing, on event-related message boards, etc.

## The Less Quick Version

**baltimore nodeschool** is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.

"Harassment" includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, language, or other material. Sponsor staff (including volunteers) should not wear overtly sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion (with no refund where applicable).

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an event volunteer or organizer immediately.

If you can't easily locate an event volunteer or organizer or if you are uncomfortable doing so, you can contact the lead organizer, Jason Rhodes, directly and discretely using any of the methods above "Need help?" section.

Event volunteers and organizers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all **baltimore nodeschool* events, including after-event socializing.
