  <p class="message"><b>interested_person:</b> so uh wtf is nodeschool???</p>
  <p class="answerbot"><b>nodeschool</b> is a series of open-source command line workshops published on nodeschool.io and created to teach people the <em>basic</em> concepts of node programming.</p>
  <p class="message"><b>brave_beginner:</b> oh ok</p>
  <p class="message"><b>brave_beginner:</b> so... what's node??</p>
  <p class="answerbot"><b>node</b> is just javascript on the server. you can write the same javascript that powers jquery to create and delete files, to make an http server, and other cool server-y things.</p>
  <p class="message"><b>sherlock_holmes:</b> so baltimore nodeschool is just a baltimore event to learn node?</p>
  <p class="answerbot"><b>yep.</b> you can do the nodeschool workshops by yourself, but itâ€™s better (and more funner) to do them as a group.</p>
  <p class="system">interested_person is now known as VERY_interested_person</p>
  <p class="message"><b>VERY_interested_person:</b> so what does a nodeschool event look like?</p>
  <p class="answerbot">we'll start with a brief intro to node and the workshopper tool, then we'll split into small groups and work together on the workshops. our awesome team of mentors will wander around and help if you get stuck.</p>
  <p class="answerbot">there'll be at least one break and we'll have plenty of <b>drinks and snacks</b> available throughout the event.</p>
  <p class="system">trolljerk has joined</p>
  <p class="answerbot">we have a <b>code of conduct</b> that we expect everyone to follow. [<a href="/conduct-code.html">baltimore nodeschool code of conduct</a>]</p>
  <p class="answerbot">
  if at any point you feel uncomfortable or unsafe for any reason, the code of conduct includes detailed contact information. let us know immediately! we want everyone to feel safe, comfortable, and generally unharassed at nodeschool events.</p>

  <p class="message me"><b><i class="fa fa-circle"></i> grizzled_longtime_programmer</b> reserved a ticket for nodeschool</p>
  <p class="message"><b>grizzled_longtime_programmer:</b> are you only doing the 'learn you node' workshop?</p>
  <p class="answerbot">for our first event, <b>we thought it would be great if we all worked through learn you node together</b>. that's the only workshop our mentors will be prepared to help with, but you're certainly welcome to come and work on any lesson you want!</p>
  <p class="answerbot">at future events, our plan now is to <b>always</b> do learn you node but to add a second, more advanced workshop to do alongside it for every event after our first.</p>
  <p class="system">secret_impostor has joined</p>
  <p class="message"><b>secret_impostor:</b> do you have to be a node expert to be a mentor?</p>
  <p class="answerbot"><b>absolutely not.</b> if you're familiar with the command line and know some javascript, try out the learn you node workshop on your own. if you make it through most of the exercises and you'd like to mentor, we'd love to have you! register as a mentor (you can always change your mind later)!</p>
