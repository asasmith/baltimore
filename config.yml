    name: ES6
    description: Each NodeSchool we offer a different "Special Focus" class that targets an advanced topic for everyone to learn together.  Our May Special Focus is going to be <b>ES6</b>, an introduction to all of the spify new features that ES6 (ECMAScript 6, ES2015) introduced to the JavaScript languages. We've had a lot of requests for this topic, so we finally decided to give it some good coverage. Very exciting stuff!
