<h1 id="sponsorship">Sponsorship</h1>
<p>We can&#39;t put on nodeschool events here in Baltimore without some help from awesome sponsors. As of right now we have two types of somewhat loosely-defined sponsorship opportunities:</p>
<h3 id="space-sponsorship">Space sponsorship</h3>
<p>Providing a location to meet with adequate space, collaborative seating, good location, parking if possible, and solid wi-fi internet and other technical needs such as projector, sound for music, etc.</p>
<h3 id="financial-sponsorship">Financial sponsorship</h3>
<p>Currently this amount is at $250 (per event)* to go toward food, drinks, supplies (signs, name badges, posters, etc) and swag (printing stickers, lanyards for mentors, t-shirts are a possibility).</p>
<p>PayPal or advance check works best here, but some companies have preferred to pick up food/drinks themselves and bring them to the event, for example. We&#39;ll work with whatever works for you. :)</p>
<p><em>*Note: this amount has worked well so far but may be adjusted depending on the size and type of event.</em></p>
<h3 id="what-you-get">What you get</h3>
<p>At either of these levels, your company name/description goes on our website, you&#39;re free to bring a sign and/or swag to put up at the event, and you can give a quick 2 minute plug during the event at some point.</p>
<p>This is also a pretty good opportunity to get in front of area node developers if you&#39;d like to mention job opportunities.</p>
<h2 id="ok-ready-to-give-us-">Ok, ready to give us $$$?</h2>
<p>Send an email to jason.matthew.rhodes@gmail.com outlining what kind of sponsorship you&#39;re interested in and we&#39;ll work with you to figure out what works best.</p>
<h2 id="thanks-">Thanks!!!!!</h2>
